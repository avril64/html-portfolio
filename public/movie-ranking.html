<h1>The Best Movies According to Avril</h1>
<h2>The top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Clueless</h3>
<p>A classic feel good movie. 90's twist on Austen's Emma. The lines are hilarous. Even though I know every word, it still makes me laugh.</p>
<h3>Being John Malkovich</h3>
<p>Such an interesting concept. Philosophical and fanastical.</p>
<h3>Requiem for a dream</h3>
<p>Depressingly real. Beautifully shot. A stark slap in the face of how addiction infiltrates our lives in different forms and what happenns when we follow escapism down the rabbit hole.</p>
